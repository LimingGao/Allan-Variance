Moving Average Estimation of irregularly sampled data using Allan Variance
==========================================================================

This particular MATLAB directory contains:
* AVAR2 function: takes a temproal signal along with a list of window lengths and outputs the Allan variance of the data for each window length
* Demo scripts (AVAR_irregular_sampling_demo_[...].m)
* other files which are used in demo scripts

After cloning the directory, start with the AVAR_irregular_sampling_demo_simple.m script. You can change the parameter dynamics at the very bottom of the script in the get_truth_at function
